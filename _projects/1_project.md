## Motivations

Ever noticed how pictures seem to stick in your memory better than words? That’s no coincidence! Due to the way that our brains process information, visualizations are proven to help us learn better than text alone {% cite Mayer2008 %}. This is why textbooks are packed with illustrations, diagrams, and photos. These visuals help us learn by summarizing words into a simpler form, showing tricky spatial relationships, keeping us engaged, and helping us spot what we might not fully understand.

But here’s a twist: what if drawing your own pictures could boost your learning even more than just looking at them? Recent research is diving into this idea and focuses on asking students to draw their own visual representations of scientific phenemon while engaged in a lesson. These lessons often involve scientific topics that have a definitive phsyical form, like how an air pump works or how blood circulates in the body {% cite schmeck2014 %}. Turns out that the process of drawing novel representations when given text-based lessons is cognitively taxing on students who find it difficult to accurately represent the material and are likely to form misconceptions if their drawings are not accurate {% cite Fiorella2018 %}. For this reason, students often learn better when drawing with the support of a teacher who can provide feedback.

But, what about the really abstract stuff, the concepts that don’t have a clear picture? Our study is digging into this uncharted territory. For these theoretical ideas that cannot be defined by a correct visual representation, it might not be as crucial for students to draw exactly what a teacher would. Instead, creating their own drawings might help them make more personal and meaningful connections, capturing their thinking in a way that enhances learning.

## Research Question

When there is no correct way to represent a scientific phenomena, does
drawing while reading an explanatory passage improve retention and
transfer more than studying an instructor provided illustration?

## Hypotheses

We hypothesize that the learning benefits of illustrations during the reading period will increase as participants generate more of their own drawings (from a to d): a. Study a provide illustration, b. Copy a provided illustration c. Complete a provided d. Create a novel drawing. We expect this effect to be strongest when learning abstract concepts.
