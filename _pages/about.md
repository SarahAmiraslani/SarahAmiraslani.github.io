Hello, I’m Sarah Amiraslani. My career is driven by deep curiosity, a passion for meaningful contributions, and a commitment to forming lasting professional relationships. I thrive on building innovative solutions, learning new technologies, and challenging myself to reach new heights.

I hold a Master of Science in Applied Data Science from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor and a Bachelor’s degree in Cognitive and Behavioral Neuroscience from the University of California, San Diego. My diverse skills have made a significant impact across various industries, including academic research, manufacturing technology, and banking.

In my professional journey, I've led projects that implemented advanced data analytics to optimize manufacturing processes, developed machine learning models to understand the coronal origins of solar wind, have conducted research in cognitive neuroscience, and other projects! My core skills include Python, SQL, data visualization, statistical analysis, and natural language processing. Currently, I am focusing on deep learning and neural networks, applying these techniques to solve complex problems in real-world scenarios.
