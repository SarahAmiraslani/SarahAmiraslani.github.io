Hello, I’m Sarah Amiraslani. My career is driven by a deep curiosity, a desire to make meaningful contributions, and to form lasting professional relationships. I love building things, learning new technologies, and challenging myself to new heights.

I hold a Master of Science in Applied Data Science from the University of Michigan and a Bachelor’s degree in Cognitive and Behavioral Neuroscience from the University of California, San Diego. I have contributed my diverse skills to various industries from academic research, manufacturing, technology, and banking.

I am a proud first-generation graduate and am always happy to provide mentorship and to find new mentors and colleagues to collaborate with on personal projects. Please reach out if interested!
