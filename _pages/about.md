Hello! I’m Sarah Amiraslani, and my career is driven by a deep curiosity and a commitment to making meaningful contributions. I thrive on developing lasting professional relationships and have brought my dynamic, inquisitive nature to diverse industries, including R1 research, banking, and startup technology. With a Master of Science in Applied Data Science from the University of Michigan and a Bachelor’s degree in Cognitive and Behavioral Neuroscience from UC San Diego, I am now seeking new opportunities in data analytics and applied work.
